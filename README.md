A football betting DB I created using the code-first uproach. 
Problem description: https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/csharp-databases/2018-May/2.%20DB-Advanced-EF-Core/05.%20DB-Advanced-Entity-Relations/05.%20DB-Advanced-EF-Core-Entity-Relations-Exercises.docx (3. Football Betting). I plan to extend it with some business-logic in the future, maybe into a console game. We'll see.
